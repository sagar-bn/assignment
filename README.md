1. Objective:
The task is to develop a 3-tier rule engine application with the following components:

Simple UI: This could be a web-based UI where users define rules using attributes (like age, department, etc.).
API and Backend: The rule engine should be capable of receiving rules from the UI and dynamically creating, modifying, and evaluating them.
Data: A database to store the rules and other metadata.
The main functionality of the rule engine is to determine user eligibility based on attributes like age, department, income, spend, etc., by evaluating rules. The rules will be stored as Abstract Syntax Trees (AST).

2. Data Structure:
You need a data structure to represent the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for rules.

Key Elements of AST:

Nodes: The AST is made up of nodes where each node can either represent an operator (AND/OR) or an operand (a condition like age > 30).
Fields for each Node:
Type: A string indicating whether the node is an operator (AND, OR) or an operand (a condition like age > 30).
Left: A reference to the left child node.
Right: A reference to the right child node.
Value: For operand nodes, this will be the condition, e.g., age > 30. For operator nodes, itâ€™s the operation (AND/OR).
Example AST for rule:

Rule: "((age > 30 AND department = 'Sales') OR (age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)"
AST Representation: This would be broken down into nodes where:
The root node is AND, combining two child nodes.
The left child represents the OR condition (age > 30 AND department = 'Sales' OR age < 25 AND department = 'Marketing').
The right child represents the OR condition (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5).
Why AST?

AST is a tree-based data structure used to represent the hierarchical structure of rules, making it easy to dynamically create, modify, and evaluate rules.
3. Data Storage:
You need to define how to store the rules and application metadata in a database.

Choice of Database: Use a relational database like PostgreSQL or MySQL since they offer flexibility in querying and storing structured data. You can store the AST in JSON format.

Schema Example:

Table: rules
Columns:
id: Auto-incrementing rule ID.
rule_name: A name for the rule (e.g., rule1, rule2).
rule_string: The original rule string.
ast: JSON representation of the AST for that rule.
Example Data Storage:

sql
Copy code
INSERT INTO rules (rule_name, rule_string, ast)
VALUES ('rule1', '((age > 30 AND department = ''Sales'') OR (age < 25 AND department = ''Marketing'')) AND (salary > 50000 OR experience > 5)', '{
    "type": "operator",
    "value": "AND",
    "left": {...},
    "right": {...}
}');
4. API Design:
Your rule engine should expose an API with the following functions:

1. create_rule(String rule_string):
Purpose: Parses the rule string and returns an AST representation.
Input: A rule string like "age > 30 AND department = 'Sales'".
Output: The root node of the AST.
Steps:

Parse the rule string.
Break the string into components (operands and operators).
Build an AST, where the nodes represent the structure of the rule.
2. combine_rules(List<String> rules):
Purpose: Combines multiple rule ASTs into a single AST.
Input: A list of rule strings.
Output: A single root node representing the combined AST.
Steps:

Convert each rule string into an AST (using create_rule).
Combine the rules logically, usually using operators like AND/OR.
Optimize for efficiency (for example, reduce redundant checks by eliminating duplicate conditions).
3. evaluate_rule(JSON data, AST ast):
Purpose: Takes a JSON object containing user attributes and evaluates whether the user matches the rule defined in the AST.
Input:
A JSON object representing user attributes (e.g., { "age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3 }).
The root node of the AST representing the rule.
Output: Returns True if the rule is satisfied, otherwise False.
Steps:

Traverse the AST.
For each operand node, evaluate the condition based on the input data.
For each operator node, apply the AND/OR logic between its children nodes.
Return True or False based on the evaluation.
5. Test Cases:
Test Case 1: Create individual rules from the examples and verify their AST representation.

Input: "age > 30 AND department = 'Sales'"
Output: AST representing the rule.
Test Case 2: Combine the example rules and ensure the resulting AST reflects the combined logic.

Input: Two rule ASTs.
Output: A single combined AST.
Test Case 3: Implement sample JSON data and test evaluate_rule for different scenarios.

Input: { "age": 35, "department": "Sales", "salary": 60000, "experience": 3 }
Output: True or False based on whether the user matches the rule.
6. Bonus Features:
Error Handling: Handle invalid rule strings or malformed data (e.g., missing operators, incorrect comparisons).
Validations: Ensure that the attributes in the rules (like age, department, salary) belong to a predefined list of valid attributes.
Rule Modification: Allow modifications to existing rules. You could add features in the create_rule function to enable changes to operators, operand values, or adding/removing conditions.
User-defined Functions: Extend the rule language to support advanced conditions like user-defined functions (e.g., a custom function that evaluates complex eligibility conditions).
Summary:
Define AST: Build a tree structure to represent logical rules.
Store Rules: Store rules and their ASTs in a database (preferably in JSON format).
Create Rules: Parse rule strings to create ASTs.
Combine Rules: Merge multiple ASTs into one.
Evaluate Rules: Use ASTs to check if given user attributes meet the conditions defined by the rules.
Bonus: Handle errors, allow rule modification, and add validations.
